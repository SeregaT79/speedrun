# speedrun

## What? 

As a no-strings-attached toolkit to help you deploy and manage your machine learning experiments, speedrun provides a base-class for your experiments. The idea is to equip you with the tools you need to have well-documented and reproducible experiments going, but without interfering with the logic.  

## How? 

So you have this next great idea, and the first thing you do is crack open an editor and write up a `main.py`. First you hard-code parameters, and not before long, you have them all over the place (speaking from experience here). If the idea sticks, you spend time tidying things up with `argparse`. Eventually you realize it'd be nice to have some plots, so you spend more time hacking together some boilerplate code. And then your job breaks down for some reason and you have to start training from scratch again, so you write even more boilerplate for saving checkpoints. By this time, your working directory is probably a mess and you have no idea what's what. 

If that's you, this is it.
